# WebGL SHCRT (Single Hit CSG Raytracing)

This is a WebGL2 implementation of the iterative algorithm presented in the article **Spatially Efficient Tree Layout for GPU Ray-tracing of Constructive Solid Geometry Scenes** by Denis Bogolepov, Danila Ulyanov, and Vadim Turlapov.

*It's still a work in progress and not all operations work equally well.*

## How to run it?
The easiest way if you have **Python 3.x** installed is to use its built-in web server. Run the below command in a terminal or cmd console
```
python -m http.server 5000
````
then open your web browser of choice and enter
```
localhost:5000
```
into the URL bar.
