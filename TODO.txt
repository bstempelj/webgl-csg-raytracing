- cylinder size should be specified in the scene (now it is fixed in code)
- box intersection could be faster and not use the swap function (see scratchapixel)
- normals on the cap of cylinders are wrong
- the csg algorithm uses 5 stacks which is too much
- implement BVH
- geometry intersection code could be split up into another file
- find a way to avoid all the NILs in the scene CSG tree definition (now they're
necessary to specify which child belong to what parent)
